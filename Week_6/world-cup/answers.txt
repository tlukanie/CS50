Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
With small anout of simulations (10 to 100)

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 
I think 1000 simulations are enough for the relatiely reliable prediction
